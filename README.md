You've been hired to build an app for the local bowling alley. They want a page that displays their regular hours, dates of tournaments, bowling alley bar menus, and eventually, a way to reserve and pay for a lane online.

But for now, they'll settle for just the basics: their name, slogan, address, and top teams.

Finish the HTML in `index.erb` using the comments to guide you. Run the rspec tests to make sure you have the appropriate content on the page.
